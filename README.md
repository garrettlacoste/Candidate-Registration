# 🗳️ Candidate Registration System

This project is a console-based registration system designed to simulate how candidates sign up and submit their information for processing. The system handles user input, validates data, and stores it in a simulated database format for review and administration.

> This is a forked version of a team project. My primary contribution was the development of unit tests to verify the correctness and reliability of the application's key components.
